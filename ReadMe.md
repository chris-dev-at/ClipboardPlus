<strong>Currently, there is no official release available.</strong><br> Therefore you must compile your own version. Also, be aware that there are very few functionalities outside the Editor. If you encounter any bugs while using this program you can notify us at contact@chris-dev.at or contact@taylouni.me.

Keybinds:
> Open Clipboard Editor & Change Clipboard ==> CTRL + SHIFT + C <br>
